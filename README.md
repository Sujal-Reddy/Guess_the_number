# Guess_the_number

A clean, interactive, and responsive browser game where players try to guess a secret number between 1 and 20. Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this project helped strengthen my DOM manipulation, event handling, and JS logic skills.



## 🕹️ How to Play

- A secret number between **1 and 20** is randomly generated.
- You start with a score of **20**.
- Each incorrect guess decreases your score by 1.
- The game provides real-time hints:
  - 📉 "Too low!"
  - 📈 "Too high!"
- When you guess correctly:
  - 🎉 The number is revealed.
  - 🎨 The background turns green.
  - 🥇 If your score is higher than the current high score, it's updated.
- Hit the **"Again!"** button to restart anytime.
